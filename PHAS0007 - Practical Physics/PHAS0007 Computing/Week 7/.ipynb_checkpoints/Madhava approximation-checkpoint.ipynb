    "## Conclusion:\n",
    "Looking at the time taken between tolerances, when calculating $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ to an extra decimal place, the time taken is roughly 10 times longer to complete the calculation. As seen when comparing tolerances from $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-8}$, for 2 decimal places the time to complete is around 100 times longer. Thus for finding $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ to 16 decimal places, which is 8 more decimal places than a tolerance of $10^{-8}$, the time taken will be $ 48.3 * 10^{8} seconds $ which is 153.056733 years and for 32 decimal places, it will take $ 48.3 * 10^{24} seconds $  or $ 1.53056733 * 10^{18} $ years. Given that it would take an extremely long time to calculate $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ to 32 decimal places shows that this algorithm, although linear, has too large a time complexity and instead an algorithm with smaller time complexity, such as O(log(n)) would be more appropriate."
