    "The following notebook incorporates animations that use Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation to simulate the orbit of planets around a star. First starting with only one planet, before simulating two planets, the first time ignoring the gravitational force between the two and the second time including the gravitational interaction. For these simulations the Euler numerical method was used to approximate the values of the position and velocity of the planets as they orbited the star. The gravitational force exerted on $m_1$ between two objects with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ is [1]:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\vec{F_{12}} = -G\\frac{m_1 m_2}{|\\vec{r}_{21}|^2} \\hat{r}_{21}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $\\vec{F_{12}}$ is the force applied on mass 1 and $\\vec{r}_{21}$ is the vector between mass 1 and mass 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this force we can calculate the acceleration by using $F =ma $ (Newton's Second Law) and thus apply Euler's numerical method which uses the following equations [1]:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ r(t+\\delta t) = r(t) +v\\delta t$$\n",
    "$$ v(t+\\delta t) = v(t) +\\delta v $$\n",
    "$$ \\delta v = a \\delta t = -\\frac{GM\\hat{r}}{|\\vec{r}|^2} \\delta t$$\n",
    "where $r$ is the position as a function of time and $v$ is the velocity as a function of time and $\\delta$ signifying a very small finite change in a quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Part A, the main goal is first creating appropriate functions to simulate a two-body system of a star and a planet orbiting the star. Part B focuses on adapting these functions to now work for 2 planets and investigating the effects of two planets in orbit around a star.\n"

    "When analysing the initial parameters that would affect the simulation, increasing the mass of the star will linearly increase the force experienced by the planet, thus cause elliptical orbits, if the velocity of the planet did not exactly correspond with the appropriate radius of orbit, then the orbit will always form an ellipse or be an unbound orbit. Circular orbits only formed when the initial velocity and position of the planet were carefully selected and calculated using Kepler's Third Law [4]. Adjusting the time step (dt) had no significant effect on calculation time, the speedup parameter had the largest effect as it would determine how long the animation would be and thus how many frames would need to be calculated. As dt was small enough that the animation smoothness depended mostly on the speedup parameter this did not need to be changed to improve the smoothness of any of the animations."

Furthermore, the moon should be of a small enough size to maintain a stable orbit otherwise the gravitational influence of the moon will destabilise its own orbit as it affects the orbit of the planet around the star."
