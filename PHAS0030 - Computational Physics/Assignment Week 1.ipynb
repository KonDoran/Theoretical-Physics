This notebook will simulate different conditions, where the granularity of the grid is adjusted; first simulating one charge, before simulating a dipole and quadrupole. First, charges will start off touching each other and will slowly move further away. I will use $\\phi = \\frac{q}{r}$ to avoid introducing any constants in order to simplify the numbers used in the simulations."

    "### Conclusions\n",
    "After creating these simulations, the same recurring issues proposed themselves: When the distance of the grid to the charge was zero, it introduced infinities into both the potential and electric fields. These would cause errors to appear even though the result could be displayed. had I invested more time, I could search through the array and replace the infinite values with zero instead to make a neater looking plot. Also, using quiver rather than streamplot for plotting the fields of multiple charges led to messy arrows due to the placement of the charges on the grid and the infinite values kept in the arrays when plotting. The plots were less helpful when using quiver compared to streamplot in the end as the continuous arrows were better for visualising the electric field interactions. Plotting a scalar quantity such as potential was a lot less difficult and easier to read compared to vector quantities as colourmaps are easy to understand. Adjusting the granularity of the grid also helps with the smoothness of the colourmap."
